## Questions You Might Get

### "How much would this cost to build for real?"
**Answer**: "This demo was built in 1-2 weeks. A full production app with backend, payment processing, and POS integration would typically take 3-4 months and cost $50-80K with a traditional agency. We can do it faster and more cost-effectively."

### "Does it work on both iPhone and Android?"
**Answer**: "This is a web app that works on both platforms. It can be wrapped in a native shell (React Native or Capacitor) for app store distribution, or remain as a progressive web app (PWA) that users can 'install' to their home screen."

### "What about payment processing?"
**Answer**: "This uses demo payment details. In production, we'd integrate Stripe, Square, or your existing payment processor. We'd also connect to your POS system for real-time order management."

### "Can it integrate with our existing systems?"
**Answer**: "Absolutely. We'd build a backend API that connects to your POS system, customer database, and payment processor. The app you see is the frontend - we can plug it into any backend."

### "How do you handle order fulfillment?"
**Answer**: "Orders would sync to your POS system in real-time. Store staff would see them on their existing screens. We can also add features like estimated wait times, order tracking, and pickup notifications."

## Closing Points

- **Speed**: "We shipped this in 1-2 weeks. Your internal team has been trying for 2 years."
- **Polish**: "Notice the attention to detail - animations, loading states, error handling."
- **Veteran-Owned**: "StephensCode is veteran-owned and operated."
- **Track Record**: "We've built similar apps for other brands."
- **Next Steps**: "We can have a production-ready MVP in 3-4 months. Let's discuss a pilot program."
